# About

Material Design Light is a lightweight CSS framework that implements the [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/) to
the full extent.

The project is heavily work in progress and offers zero support or assurances on anything.

## Quick start

Several quick start options are available:

- [Download the latest release](https://github.com/mdlightdev/material-design-light/releases/latest)
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mdlightdev/material-design-light.git`
- Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/material-design-light): `npm i material-design-light`
- Install with [Composer](): `composer require mdlightdev/material-design-light`

## What's included

Within the download you'll find the following directories and files, logically grouping common assets and providing both
compiled and minified variations.

```text
material-design-light/
└── css/
    ├── material-design-light.css
    ├── material-design-light.css.map
    └── material-design-light.min.css
```

Material Design Light provides compiled CSS (`material-design-light.*`), as well as compiled and minified
CSS (`material-design-light.min.*`). Source maps (`material-design-light.*.map`) are available for use with certain
browsers' developer tools.
