# Code of Conduct

## Scope
This code of conduct applies to on-topic development channels of the project. This
includes but is not limited to:
- Bug trackers
- Development repositories
- Mailing lists
- Non-development platforms if misbehaviour is also applicable to development channels
- Any other communication method for development of software

Off-topic channels are subject to their own rules and guidelines.

## Standards of Communication

We expect all users to stay on-topic while using development channels. 

We will not accept the following:

- Stalking and witchhunting
- Arguments, and off-topic debates
- Ad hominems
- Attempts to flame, or otherwise derail communication
- Troll feeding

If you see misbehaviour, ignore the person(s) and speak with a lead maintainer.
